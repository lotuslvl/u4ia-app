Find Yourself

PROBLEM STATEMENT

How can we facilitate and gamify the name selection process to be more fun, collaborative and personal for trans community members?

PROJECT SUMMARY

The goal of this project is to create an MVP of the app, u4ia. u4ia (pronounced: you-for-ee-uh) is the world's first adult name finder. It allows transgender, non-binary and gender non-conforming teens and adults to explore names that match their gender identity through a fun swipe left-and-right design. You can think of it as the tinder of legal name change. The app provides a social experience that allows friends and family to weigh in and comment on the user's favorite name list. When the user has selected their new name, u4ia offers tips and legal guidance to make the name change a reality. u4ia: Find Yourself.

USER ARCHETYPES

1.  Transgender teens/young adults seeking legal name change

2. Non-binary teens/young adults seeking social name change

3. Family and friends of trans individuals.

CORE USER STORIES

1. I want to search for names based on: popularity, meaning, origin, syllables, length

2. I want to be introduced to names and click left to ignore names and click right to favorite names so I never have to see names I dislike again and I can refer back to names I like later.

3. I want to be able to invite friends and family to a page of my favorite names by sending them a link so they can vote and write comments on the names I have favorited to help me decide and give them an outlet to support.

4. I want the design and branding of the application to reflect my identity and interests as a gender-non conforming adult so that I feel like this application was made for me and I don't have to worry about encountering transphobic BS of "baby name" sites.

5.  I want legal information about how to make a name change happen in my state including a to-do checklist and tips so that I can easily navigate the name change process.

SECONDARY USER STORIES

1. I want the system to suggest names for me based on a personality test.

2. I want the system to suggest names to me based on my interests.

3. I want to see what the name looks like with other names I have. (ie my last name is Hernandez and in the broswer I want to see how the first name looks with my last name)

4. I want to see names that are similar to my current name.

5. I want to see names other folks picked as inspiration and a deadname list to celebrate as a community.
